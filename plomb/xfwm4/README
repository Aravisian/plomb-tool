Plomb Tool Co. Theme created by Aravisian

Plomb Tool Co. was a manufacturer of High Quality High Strength tools in the olden days. With a very impressive company history that includes environmentalism and that challenged society stances on sexism and racism and that protected and even financially supported competitor companies, Plomb Tools were THE tool to own in their time. In the Second Great War (WWII), Plomb supplied the allies under the Wright Field Contract - much of the tooling remains to this day, changing collector hands across the Globe. Built to last, many of these tools are not only still around, but will outlast those of us enjoying this theme, today.
Where Greed takes over, Quality is lost. Complacency enables loss. As curators of what once was, we stand to remind that Quality begins in the hands of the person that creates, imagines, builds, crafts and shares quality with others.
The future is ours to create; history ours to make. As we look forward to challenging the racism, sexism and bigotry of the past, let us retain from it the Quality, Pride and Innovation that got us to where we are today.

HACKING (If it can be called that...): I set this to come with OTS enabled. If you wish to not have the Stick and Shade buttons on the left side, open the themerc and where you see OTS|HMC, remove the TS to make it O|HMC
